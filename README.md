# grocery-store-cnn

This repo contains the code for the project of the course "Image Processing and Computer Vision" for the AI Master at the University of Bologna. The project consists in the classification of images of products in a grocery store dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks.

The project is divided in 2 parts:

- Build a CNN from scratch
- Use a pre-trained model (ResNet18) and fine-tune it.

## Content

The project is inside the file `assignment_module_2.ipynb`. The dataset is in the folder `grocery_store_dataset`.

## Model

To see the full model specification see the file `assignment_module_2.ipynb`. Here you can also find all the experminets done and the results.

## Extra

This project is for the module 2 of the course. To see to project for the module 1 see the repo [opencv-instance-detection](https://github.com/NotXia/opencv-instance-detection).
