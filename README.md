# Grocery Store CNN

This repo contains the code of the project for the course "Image Processing and Computer Vision" of the Master in AI at the University of Bologna. The project consists in classifying images of products in the [Grocery Store Dataset](https://github.com/marcusklasson/GroceryStoreDataset) using Convolutional Neural Networks.

The project is divided into 2 parts:

- Build a CNN from scratch.
- Use a pre-trained model (ResNet18) and fine-tune it.

## Content

The project is inside the file `assignment_module_2.ipynb`. The dataset is in the directory `grocery_store_dataset`.

## Model

To see the full model specification, see the file `assignment_module_2.ipynb`. Here you can also find all the experiments done and the results.

## Extra

This project is for the 2nd module of the course. The project for the 1st module is at the repo [opencv-instance-detection](https://github.com/NotXia/opencv-instance-detection).
